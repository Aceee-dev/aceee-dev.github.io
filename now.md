## Currently in my life ... 

{% highlight txt %}
 Recently a lot has happened in my life. Both happy and sad moments but I think that is part of our life. We need to keep moving forward. Recently I got graduated from NIT Tiruchirappalli majoring in CSE. I closely follow few of my friends and they always guide me and I would like to say thanks a lot to them. Just few days before I started to give my end sems, sad news struck me, firstly my beloved Grandfather passed away and I was recovering from his demise and then a mail again disheartened me. That mail was from my company in which I was placed and it stated that they are postponing my joining at least by 6 months. I am still hopeful that one day i will also be a software developer like my friends and till then, keep learning and keep growing. Do not judge me, recently I started watching star wars and I am loving it.

 Bye Bye
