## About Me

Hi there, My name is Anukul Chand and thanks for visiting this page. I graduated from [National Institute of Technology,Tiruchirappalli](https://www.nitt.edu/) majoring in `Computer Science and Engineering`. 

I am interested in `Android App Development`,  `Server Side Development` and `Machine learning` respectively. I also enjoy doing competitive programming and learning new technologies.

Leaving tech stuff aside, I enjoy movie,music,football and badminton. I absolutely adore nature and natural beings.
