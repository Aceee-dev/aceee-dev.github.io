## About Me

Hi there, My name is Anukul Chand and thanks for visiting this page. I graduated from [National Institute of Technology,Tiruchirappalli](https://www.nitt.edu/) majoring in `Computer Science and Engineering`. 

In development side, I am interested in `Server Side Development`,`Android App Development` and `Machine learning` respectively. I also enjoy doing competitive programming and mainly use platforms like hackerearth,codechef for practising it. Currently, I am at home and learning new technologies.

Leaving computer stuff aside I am an avid movie and music lover. I also enjoy and adore natural beauty like clouds,mountains,trees and plants. Recently started binging anime and finding it amazing.
