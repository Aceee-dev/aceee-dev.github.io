Hi there, My name is Anukul Chand and thanks for visiting this page. I have recently graduated from [National Institute of Technology,Tiruchirappalli](https://www.nitt.edu/) majoring in `Computer Science and Engineering`. 

In development side, I am interested in `Server Side Development`,`Android App Development` and `Machine learning` respectively. I also enjoy doing competitive programming and mainly use platforms like hackerearth,codechef for practising it. Currently, I am at home and learning new technologies. I am also doing an internship at which I am working as a `backend developer` in `Django` and also enjoy working with some cool people. 

I am learning about docker,kubernetes and testing based development. I am also learning `MERN` stack while developing some beginner level projects. I am also working on a cool open source project [felicette](https://github.com/plant99/felicette) whenever I can manage.

Leaving computer stuff aside I am an avid movie and music lover. I also enjoy and adore natural beauty like clouds,mountains,trees and plants.
